## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <a name="executivesum"></a>
This report proposes a social insurance program designed to relieve the economic costs associated with climate-related catastrophes in Storslysia. The primary objective of the program is to mitigate the financial consequences for residents residing in high-risk areas facing displacement. The program covers costs arising from climate-related hazards such as temporary housing and household contents, but further assists Storslysia manage displacement risk through a buyback scheme aimedtowards high-risk, low value properties. By implementing the program, the program will reduce economic costs associated with climate catastrophe-related events by approximately 16.58% in the short-term and 28.75% in the long-term. Furthermore, the proposed social insurance program will continue to lower costs even if the climate situation deteriorates as represented by Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)scenarios. Hence, with 95% confidence, the program costs do not exceed 10% of Storslysia’s 
annual GDP in all four SSP scenarios. However, risks such as increasingly correlated hazard events pose threats to the program meaning ongoing monitoring is recommended.

## SECTION 1: PROGRAM SYNOPSIS

### OBJECTIVES <a name="objectives"></a>
The proposed social insurance program is designed to provide citizens with financial protection and support from climate-related events. The program aims to reduce the costs associated with displacement and support the overall resilience of affected communities and individuals. More detailed outlines of the objectives are as below:

**1. Mitigating Displacement Risk**
The program will reduce displacement risk by incentivising proactive relocation, offering abuyback scheme to houses of low-income policyholders living in high-risk regions, enabling them to relocate before or after a severe or catastrophic climate-related event. This helps reduce costs associated with emergency displacement, improving the overall effectiveness of the program.

**2.Financial Protection for Policyholders**
The program provides policyholders with financial protection against the costs associated with voluntary, proactive relocation as well as involuntary displacement following a catastrophic event. 

**3. Financial Sustainability for Storslysia**
The program is constructed to be financially sustainable over the long-term by establishing appropriate premium levels, deductibles, and coverage limits that align with the expected costs of claims and ensure solvency.

**4. Alleviating Climate Risk Pressure**
The program is designed to relieve financial pressures of voluntary and involuntary relocation of citizens affected by catastrophic climate-related events, reducing economic and psychological burdens to Storslysia’s population

### 1.2 PROGRAM METRICS <a name="programmetrics"></a>
This program will be assessed using the following five metrics: 

  ***1. Policyholder uptake:*** The number of policyholders who have enrolled in the program, broken down by geographic region and demographics such as property value.

  ***2. Claims frequency and severity:*** The number and cost of claims made by policyholders under the program, broken down by voluntary and involuntary relocation. 

  ***3. Relocation rates:*** The number and percentage of policyholders who have relocated proactively, broken down by geographic region and demographics. 

  ***4. Customer satisfaction:*** Feedback from policyholders on their satisfaction with the program, 
including its coverage and customer service. 

  ***5. Financial sustainability:*** The program's financial performance, including premiums with relocation exceed 10% of Storslysia’s GDP annually.

To track initial program uptake and document claims experience, these metrics may be reported on a monthly or quarterly basis. In the long-term, these metrics may be reported on an annual or biennial basis to evaluate the program's ongoing success in meeting its objectives.

## SECTION 2: PROGRAM DESIGN <a name="programdesign"></a>
### 2.1 REQUIREMENTS <a name="requirements"></a>
To file a claim within this program, policyholders must satisfy certain requirements including:
- Documentation of the damage, such as taking photos or videos of the damage, or providing a detailed inventory of the items that were lost or damaged.
- Notification to insurance program of damage details.
- Proof of ownership, which may include receipts, invoices, or other documentation that shows when the property was purchased.
- Proof of displacement for those claiming relocation fees, where policyholders need to provide proof of temporary living arrangements, such as receipts for hotel stays or rental agreements.
- Compliance with policy terms, where policyholders must pay premiums on time and provide accurate information when applying for the policy and making any claims.

### 2.2 COVERAGE AND FEATURES <a name="coverage"></a>
This insurance program will cover the following areas: 
- ***Proactive relocation:*** Financial assistance for individuals or families who voluntarily relocate to a safer area prior to a catastrophic event. This will involve offering to buyback houses, with limitations described below.
- ***Involuntary displacement:*** Coverage for involuntary displacement following a hazard event will include financial assistance to cover the costs of temporary housing and property damage.
- ***Other expenses:*** The social insurance program may also cover other expenses related to displacement, such as transportation costs, storage costs for personal belongings. 
- ***Limitations of coverage:***  The program has a deductible of $1,000 and limit of $600,000. Additionally, temporary housing costs following a hazard event will only be covered by the program for 6 months. The buyback scheme will only be offered to houses valued below Ꝕ300K in Storslysia that are at risk of severe or catastrophic hazard events. Refer to Appendix A for further detail.
- ***Voluntary RElocation Incentives:*** Through the buyback scheme, policyholders will be incentivised to relocate to lower-risk areas in order to reduce the likelihood of displacement and pay reduced premiums.

### 2.3 QUALITATIVE/QUANTITATIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR PROGRAM  <a name="qualitative"></a>
Economic costs as defined under the program include property damage, labour and material costs, business interruption costs, temporary housing costs and contents coverage costs. The social insurance program is necessary to reduce the burden of such costs for both the government and the citizens of Storslysia, and to implement preventative measures as the climate situation worsens as depicted in the SSP scenarios. The proposed program will reduce economic costs by approximately 16.58% in the short-term and 28.75% in the long-term, which will be validated in Section 3. 

### 2.4 SHORT-TERM & LONG-TERM PROGRAM EVALUATION TIME FRAME  <a name="qualitative"></a>
A short-term time frame of 10 years (2020-30) was selected to obtain sufficient data points to evaluate program success using the aforementioned metrics. Over the short-term, ongoing monitoring and adjustments to the insurance program can be made.
The long-term time frame of 50 years (2020-70) was selected to account for climate factors that shift over multiple decades. This includes temperature, sea level, and other variables that impact risks like coastal erosion. Additionally, it often takes time for the effects of government climate policies to be realised. Time frames of over 50 years were deemed impractical and unmanageable as they are often superseded in priority by shorter-term events.

## SECTION 3: PRICING & COSTS <a name="pricencost"></a>
The program aims to generate sufficient reserves to cover claims incurred from hazard events, 
which are modelled as below. 

### 3.1 DAMAGE MODEL <a name="dmgmodel"></a>
#### 3.1.1 FITTING A PROPERTY DAMAGE DISTRIBUTION
Property damage was modelled by considering the occurrence of climate-related catastrophes. As hazard events like floods, bushfires and hurricanes are low frequency but high impact, a statistical approach known as Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) was conducted to capture information at the tails, where the rarest and most extreme events occur (see Appendix B). There are three extreme value distributions (EVDs) commonly used, namely the Gumbel, Weibull and Fréchet distributions. 

Each distribution was accordingly fitted to the property damage data and compared using statistical tests including AIC, BIC, and Log-Likelihood to determine the best model. The results of the analysis indicate that the Fréchet distribution provides the best fit for the dataset, as evidenced by its superior performance across all statistical tests and goodness-of-fit plots (see Appendix C).

*Table 1: Results of statistical tests for extreme value distributions*

| Distribution| AIC         | BIC           | Log-Likelihood | Final Selection |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-------------: |:-------------:  |
| Gumbel      | 7743.014    | 7749.4        | -3869.507      | ✘              |
| Weibull     | 4835.001    | 4841.387      | -2415.50       |✘               |
| Fréchet     | 4821.952    | 4831.53       | -2407.976      |✔               |

Known to have the best performance in capturing heavy right tails, the Fréchet distribution is 
commonly used in studies to model extreme phenomena in fields such as meteorology, hydrology, and finance (RAL 2022). With a shape parameter (α), scale parameter (σ), and location parameter (μ), the parameter estimates are shown in Appendix D and the probability 
density function is shown below:

	\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
        
	$ f(x;α,σ,μ) = \frac{α}{σ} × $

#### 3.1.2 CALCULATING RETURN PERIOD
With a distribution fitted to the data, return periods of 2, 5, 10 and 100 years were set as benchmarks for quantifying the damages of Minor, Moderate, Severe and Catastrophic events. The return period is defined as the time between disasters of a particular scale occurring, meaning that a 1-in-100-year hazard event was set to be catastrophic in terms of severity. With the Fréchet distribution, the damage level that corresponded to a given quantile was calculated, where quantiles were set as
		
		$$
For example, to obtain a damage estimate of a minor event, the 50% quantile of our fitted distribution was taken.

#### 3.1.3 OBTAINING CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
To determine confidence intervals (CIs) for the predictions, percentile bootstrapping was chosen over other bootstrapping methods to generate more stable results, given there are many extreme data points. The dataset was resampled \beta = 1000 times with replacement, and from each resampled dataset, a hazard rate and severity value were calculated for each of the 6 regions. The 95% confidence interval was then constructed as follows by taking the interval between the 25th quantile value to the 975th quantile value from the 1000 estimates in the bootstrapped sample:
