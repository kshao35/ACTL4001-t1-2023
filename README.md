## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
This report investigates the proposed social insurance program designed to relocate citizens of Storslysia affected by climate-related catastrophes. The primary objective of the program is to mitigate the financial consequences for residents residing in high-risk areas facing permanent displacement. By implementing the program, the government aims to minimise the economic impact of these events, which are becoming increasingly frequent and costly. 

## Executive Summary <a name="executivesum"></a>
This report outlines  

### Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
Overall, the proposed social insurance program is designed to help Storslysia manage displacement risk from catastrophic climate-related events, providing citizens with financial protection and support before and after such events occur. By achieving these objectives, the program can help to reduce the costs associated with displacement and support the overall resilience of communities and individuals affected by such events. More detailed outlines of the objectives are below: 

*Mitigating Displacement Risk*

The program is designed to reduce displacement risk by providing policyholders with the financial resources necessary to relocate before or after a catastrophic climate-related event. 

*Providing Financial Protection* 

The program provides policyholders with financial protection against the costs associated with voluntary, proactive relocation as well as involuntary displacement following a catastrophic event. 

*Encouraging Proactive Relocation*

The program design includes incentives to encourage policyholders to relocate proactively before a catastrophic event occurs. This helps reduce costs associated with reactive relocation and improves the overall effectiveness of the program. 

*Ensuring Financial Sustainability*

The program is constructed to be financially sustainable over the long-term by establishing appropriate premium levels, deductibles, and coverage limits that align with the expected costs of claims. 

*Supporting Policyholders*

The program is designed to relieve financial pressures of voluntary and involuntary relocation of citizens affected by catastrophic climate-related events, overall reducing emotional and psychological pressures on policyholders.  

## Program Metrics <a name="programmetrics"></a>
This program will be assessed using the following five metrics: 

  1. Policyholder uptake: The number of policyholders who have enrolled in the program, broken down by geographic region and demographics. 

  2. Claims frequency and severity: The number and cost of claims made by policyholders under the program, broken down by voluntary and involuntary relocation. 

  3. Relocation rates: The number and percentage of policyholders who have relocated proactively, broken down by geographic region and demographics. 

  4. Customer satisfaction: Feedback from policyholders on their satisfaction with the program, including its coverage, customer service, and support services. 

  5. Financial sustainability: The program's financial performance, including premiums collected, claims paid, and any surplus or deficit. This metric will also assess whether the costs associated with relocation exceed the 10% of GDP annually.  

In the short-term, these metrics may be reported on a monthly or quarterly basis to track program uptake and claims experience. In the long-term, these metrics may be reported on an annual or biennial basis to evaluate the program's ongoing success in meeting its objectives.
