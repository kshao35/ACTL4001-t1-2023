## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
This report investigates the proposed social insurance program designed to relocate citizens of Storslysia affected by climate-related catastrophes. The primary objective of the program is to mitigate the financial consequences for residents residing in high-risk areas facing permanent displacement. By implementing the program, the government aims to minimise the economic impact of these events, which are becoming increasingly frequent and costly. 

## Executive Summary <a name="executivesum"></a>
This report outlines  

## Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
Overall, the proposed social insurance program is designed to help Storslysia manage displacement risk from catastrophic climate-related events, providing citizens with financial protection and support before and after such events occur. By achieving these objectives, the program can help to reduce the costs associated with displacement and support the overall resilience of communities and individuals affected by such events. More detailed outlines of the objectives are below: 

*Mitigating Displacement Risk*

The program is designed to reduce displacement risk by providing policyholders with the financial resources necessary to relocate before or after a catastrophic climate-related event. 

*Providing Financial Protection* 

The program provides policyholders with financial protection against the costs associated with voluntary, proactive relocation as well as involuntary displacement following a catastrophic event. 

*Encouraging Proactive Relocation*

The program design includes incentives to encourage policyholders to relocate proactively before a catastrophic event occurs. This helps reduce costs associated with reactive relocation and improves the overall effectiveness of the program. 

*Ensuring Financial Sustainability*

The program is constructed to be financially sustainable over the long-term by establishing appropriate premium levels, deductibles, and coverage limits that align with the expected costs of claims. 

*Supporting Policyholders*

The program is designed to relieve financial pressures of voluntary and involuntary relocation of citizens affected by catastrophic climate-related events, overall reducing emotional and psychological pressures on policyholders.  

### Program Metrics <a name="programmetrics"></a>
This program will be assessed using the following five metrics: 

  1. Policyholder uptake: The number of policyholders who have enrolled in the program, broken down by geographic region and demographics. 

  2. Claims frequency and severity: The number and cost of claims made by policyholders under the program, broken down by voluntary and involuntary relocation. 

  3. Relocation rates: The number and percentage of policyholders who have relocated proactively, broken down by geographic region and demographics. 

  4. Customer satisfaction: Feedback from policyholders on their satisfaction with the program, including its coverage, customer service, and support services. 

  5. Financial sustainability: The program's financial performance, including premiums collected, claims paid, and any surplus or deficit. This metric will also assess whether the costs associated with relocation exceed the 10% of GDP annually.  

In the short-term, these metrics may be reported on a monthly or quarterly basis to track program uptake and claims experience. In the long-term, these metrics may be reported on an annual or biennial basis to evaluate the program's ongoing success in meeting its objectives. 

## Program Design <a name="programdesign"></a>
### Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
To make claims within this program, policyholders must satisfy certain requirements including: 
- Documentation of the damage, such as taking photos or videos of the damage, or providing a detailed inventory of the items that were lost or damaged. 
- Notification to insurance program, including details of the damage and the policy number. 
- Proof of ownership, which may include receipts, invoices, or other documentation that shows when and where the property was purchased 
- Proof of displacement for those claiming relocation fees, where policyholders need to provide proof of temporary living arrangements, such as receipts for hotel stays or rental agreements. 
- Compliance with policy terms, where the policyholder must pay premiums on time, provide accurate information when applying for the policy, and meet any other requirements set out in the policy. 

### Coverage <a name="coverage"></a>
This insurance program will cover the following areas: 
- Proactive relocation: Financial assistance for individuals or families who voluntarily relocate to a safer area prior to a catastrophic event. This might include assistance with moving expenses, housing costs, and related expenses such as utility deposits. 
- Involuntary displacement: Coverage for involuntary displacement following a catastrophic event could include financial assistance to cover the costs of finding or building new housing, replacing lost household items. This could include assistance with rental deposits, temporary housing expenses, and long-term housing solutions such as rebuilding or purchasing a new home. 
- Other expenses: The social insurance program may also cover other expenses related to displacement, such as transportation costs, storage costs for personal belongings. 
- Limitations of coverage: The program may only cover a portion of the costs associated with relocation, or there may be a maximum amount that can be claimed per policyholder. Additionally, there may be specific exclusions or limitations related to the cause or type of event that triggers coverage. We will also most likely set a deductible.  
    - Different premiums depending on region and property value  
    - We will not insure ACUTE events

### Incentives to Encourage Voluntary Relocation  <a name="incentives"></a>
This program incentivises voluntary relocation by offering policyholders financial assistance, including moving expenses, temporary housing costs, and related expenses such as utility deposits. Furthermore, it also includes different premiums depending on region, determined by the risks associated with various regions.  

Other incentives can be introduced in line with those inherent within the insurance program, including assistance with identifying suitable housing options, finalising rental agreements, and accessing resources including education, employment, and healthcare services. The government can further supplement this program with disaster preparedness training, increasing awareness of the risks of climate-related events and providing practical guidance on how to prepare. Furthermore, incentives aimed at community engagement such as social events and activities can facilitate smoother transitions for people willing to voluntarily relocate.
